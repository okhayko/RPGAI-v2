Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

  1. Design Regex Rule Data Structure
  - Create TypeScript interfaces for regex rules
  - Define placement enums for different processing contexts
  - Add regex rule storage to game state management

  2. Create Regex Processing Engine
  - Build core engine similar to SillyTavern's approach
  - Implement placement-based rule execution
  - Add macro substitution support ({{player}}, {{location}}, etc.)
  - Handle depth control and conditional processing

  Phase 2: User Interface

  3. Build Regex Management UI
  - Create regex rule editor modal with:
    - Pattern input with syntax highlighting
    - Live preview/testing functionality
    - Placement selection checkboxes
    - Enable/disable toggles
  - Add drag-and-drop rule ordering
  - Include bulk operations (enable/disable/delete)

  4. Add Regex Tab to Main Interface
  - Integrate regex management into existing tab system
  - Position alongside Settings, Memory, and other tabs
  - Maintain consistent UI styling with current design

  Phase 3: Game Integration

  5. Integrate into Game Action Handlers
  - Process player input before command parsing
  - Apply formatting rules to user actions
  - Extract structured data from player commands

  6. AI Response Processing
  - Auto-format AI output (bold actions, italic thoughts)
  - Clean up repetitive phrases and formatting artifacts
  - Extract game data (stats, items, locations) automatically

  7. Memory System Enhancement
  - Auto-tag memories by content type (combat, dialogue, discovery)
  - Clean memory entries before storage
  - Extract key events and entities from responses

  Phase 4: Content & Polish

  8. Default Rule Templates
  - Combat formatting rules
  - Dialogue styling patterns
  - Stat extraction patterns
  - Entity detection rules
  - Memory categorization rules

  9. Import/Export Functionality
  - Export rule sets as JSON files
  - Import community-created rule packs
  - Share rules between game sessions

  10. Testing & Validation
  - Test with various game scenarios
  - Validate regex performance with large rule sets
  - Ensure compatibility with existing game features

  Integration Points

  File Modifications Required:
  - components/types.ts - Add regex rule interfaces
  - components/hooks/useGameState.ts - Regex rule storage
  - components/handlers/gameActionHandlers.ts - Input processing
  - components/promptBuilder.ts - AI response processing
  - components/utils/UnifiedMemoryManager.ts - Memory processing
  - New files: components/utils/RegexEngine.ts,
  components/RegexManager.tsx

  Expected Benefits:
  - Consistent text formatting across all game interactions
  - Automatic extraction of game data from AI responses
  - Enhanced memory organization and tagging
  - Professional polish to game presentation
  - Extensible system for community rule sharing

  This systematic approach ensures robust implementation while maintaining     
   compatibility with your existing codebase.
